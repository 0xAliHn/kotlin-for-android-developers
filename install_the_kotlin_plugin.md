# Install the Kotlin plugin

~~IDE it does not understand Kotlin itself. As mentioned in the previous section, it is designed for Java development. But the Kotlin team created a series of powerful plug-ins to make it easier for us to achieve. Go to the `Plugin` column in` Preferences` in Android Studio and install the following two plugins:~~
- ~~Kotlin: This is a basic plugin. It allows Android Studio to understand Kotlin code. It will publish a new plugin version every time the new Kotlin language version is released, so that we can discover new version features and discarded warnings through it. This is the only plugin you want to use Kotlin to write Android apps. But we still need another one now.~~
- ~~Kotlin Android Extensions: Kotlin team for Android development also released another interesting plug-in. This Android Extensions allows you to automatically inject all View from Activity in XML. For example, you do not need to use `findViewById ()`. You will immediately get a view of the conversion from the property. You will need to install this plugin to use this feature. We will explain this in depth in the next chapter.~~

Because from the Intellij 15, the plugin is installed by default, but your Android Studio may not. So you need to enter the Android Studio Preferences plugin bar, and then install the Kotlin plugin. If you will not go to search the next.

Now our environment is already understandable Kotlin language, you can like us to use Java as a seamless compilation of it, the implementation of it.
