# Flow control and ranges

I used some conditional expressions in our code, but it is time to go deeper to explain them. We usually use procedural programming language when we rarely use code flow control mechanism to write (some procedural programming language has almost disappeared), but they are still very useful. It is also a new powerful idea to make it easier to solve some of the problems in a particular situation.
