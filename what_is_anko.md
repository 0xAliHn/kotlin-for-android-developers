# What is Anko?

Anko is a powerful library developed by JetBrains. Its main purpose is to replace the previous XML way to use the code to generate UI layout. This is a very interesting feature, I recommend you can try the next, but I am temporarily in this project do not use it. It is easier for me (probably because of years of UI drawing experience) to use XML, but you will like that way.

However, this is not the only function we can get in this library. Anko contains a lot of very helpful functions and attributes to avoid getting you to write a lot of template code. We will see many examples through this book, but you should quickly realize that the library to help you solve what kind of problem.

Although Anko is very helpful, but I suggest you have to understand what is behind this in the end. You can jump to Anko's source code at any time using `ctrl + click` (Windows) or `cmd + click` (Mac). Anko's implementation is very helpful in learning most of the Kotlin language.
