# While and do / while loops

You can also use the `while` loop, although both of them are not particularly useful. They can usually be easier, more visually easier to understand the way to solve a problem, two examples:

```kotlin
while(x > 0){ 
	x--
}

do{
	val y = retrieveData()
} while (y != null) // y在这里是可见的!
```
