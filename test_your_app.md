# Test your app

We are about to reach the end of the trip. Through this book you have learned most of the knowledge of Kotlin, but you may wonder if you can test your only use Kotlin prepared Android App? The answer is: of course!

In Android we have two different tests: `unit test` and` instrumentation test`. It is clear that this book will not teach you how to test, there are many specifically written for this book. My goal in this chapter is how to build your test environment, show you to see Kotlin in the test can also work very well.
