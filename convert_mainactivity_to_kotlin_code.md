# Convert `MainActivity` to Kotlin code

Kotlin plugin contains an interesting feature that turns Java code into Kotlin code. As with any automation, the results will not be perfect, but it will provide a lot of help on the first day before you can start writing your code in Kotlin.

So we use it in the `MainActivity.java` class. Open the file and select `Code` -> `Convert Java File to Kotlin File`. The difference between them can make you more familiar with the language.
