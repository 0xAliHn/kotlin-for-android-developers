# Convert `MainActivity` to Kotlin code

An interesting feature the Kotlin plugin includes is the ability to convert from Java to Kotlin code.
As any automated process, it wonâ€™t be perfect, but it will help a lot during your first days until you
start getting used to Kotlin language.

So we are using it in our `MainActivity.java` class. Open the file and select `Code` -> `Convert Java File to Kotlin File`. Take a look at the differences, so that you start becoming familiar with the
language.
