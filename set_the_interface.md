# Set the interface

Until now, we are using the default city to implement this app, but now it is time to add a function to select the city. Our App needs a setting bar to let the user modify the city.

We use `zip code` (zip code) to distinguish between cities. A real App may need more information, because only the zip code in the whole world may not be used as a basis for identification. But we will at least show the world's cities defined in the settings using `zip code`. This would be an example of how to use the funny way to handle preferences.
