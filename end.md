# END

Thank you for reading this book. Through this book, we learned through the example of an Android App to learn Kotlin. The weather forecast App is a good example, it implements most of the App need some of the basic features: a master / slave UI, through the API communication, database storage, shared preferences ... ...

The good place to use this way is that you use their use to learn most of the important concepts in Kotlin. I think the new language is more easily grasped in real practice. This is my main goal, the reference book is indeed a good tool to solve some of the standard problems, but we read from start to finish is very difficult. And as some examples are also out of a large context, it is difficult to understand what these characteristics can solve the problem.

And in fact the other goals of this book: show you the real problems you will encounter in Android, and how to use Kotlin to solve them. Some Android developers find a lot of problems when dealing with asynchronous, database, or handling very lengthy listener in Activity. Through the real App as an example, we encountered a lot of problems and learned the characteristics of new languages ​​and libraries.

I hope that these goals have been met, and I really hope that you are not only learning Kotlin, but also in the book reading to enjoy. I was persuaded, Kotlin for Android developers is the best alternative to Java, we will see its progress in the next time. When it happens, you will be the first person to board the boat, and in your circle you will be in a perfect reference person's position.

The book is over, but it does not mean that it is dead. I will always keep the update (at least 1.0) based on the latest version, according to your comments and suggestions to check and optimize it. Have any idea to be able to contact me at any time, tell me your thoughts, the mistakes you find, the notions that are clear enough, or anything that you are worried about.

The process of writing this book for a few months has gone through an incredible trip. I have learned a lot, so thank you for your help to make the book `Kotlin for Android Developers` this book a reality.

best wishes to you,

Antonio Leiva
