# About this book

In this book, I will use Kotlin as the main language to develop an android application. The way is through the development of an application to learn this language, rather than according to the traditional structure to learn. I will stop at the point of interest through the way with Java1.7 Kotlin talk about some of the concepts and characteristics. In this way you will be able to know their differences, and know which part of the language features can let you improve your work efficiency.

This book is not a language reference book, but it is an Android developer to learn Kotlin and use a tool in its own project. I will use a number of language features and interesting tools and libraries to solve many of our daily life will encounter typical problems.

This book is very practical, so I suggest you follow my example and code practice in front of the computer. Whenever you can have some ideas in the depth of practice to go.

As you know, it's a lean publication. That is to say that this book is written with you. I will be based on your reply and suggestions to write new content and check the previous content. Although this book has been completed, but I will be updated in accordance with the new Kotlin version. So despite the preparation of advice to tell me your views on this book, or need to improve the place. I hope this book will be a perfect tool for Android developers, because of this, welcome everyone's ideas and help.

Thank you will be part of this exciting project.
