# Create a project in Android Studio

First of all, open Android Studio and choose `Create new Project`. It will ask for a name, you can
call it whatever you want: ` Weather App` for instance.Then you need to set a Company Domain. As
you are not releasing the app, this field is not very important either, but if you own a domain, you
can use that one. Also choose the location where you want to save the project.

In the next step, you’ll be asked about the minimum API version. We’ll select API 15, because one
of the libraries we’ll be using needs API 15 as minimum. You’ll be targeting most Android users
anyway. Don’t choose any other platform rather than Phone and Tablet for now.

Finally, we are required to choose an activity template to start with. We can choose Add no Activity
and start from scratch (that would be the best idea when starting a Kotlin project), but we’ll rather
choose  `Empty Activity` because I’ll show you later an interesting feature from the Kotlin plugin.

Don’t worry much about the name of the activities, layouts, etc. that you will find in next screen.
We’ll change them later if we need to. Press `Finish` and let Android Studio do its work.
