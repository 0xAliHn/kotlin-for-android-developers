# Create a project in Android Studio

First, open Android Studio and select `Create new Project`, then it will let you enter a name, you can take any name, such as:` Weather App`. Then you need to enter the company domain name. If you do not really publish this app, this field is not particularly important, but if you have any words you can use your own domain name. And then choose a directory as any of the preservation of the address.

The next step, it will let you choose the smallest API version. We chose API 15 because we have a library that requires at least API 15 to be used. In any case you put most of the Anroid users as a target. Do not choose any other platforms except mobile phones and tablets.

Finally, we need to select an Activity template as an entry. We can choose `Add no Activity` and start from scratch (it's a good way if this is a Kotlin item), but I will choose` Blank Activity` because I'll show you a Kotlin plugin for a while Small features.

Temporarily do not have to care about the name of Activity, layout and so on. You will know the next one. If we need it, I will modify it later. Click `Finish 'and let it continue to create the project.
