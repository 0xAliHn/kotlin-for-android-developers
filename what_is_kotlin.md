# What is Kotlin?

Kotlin, as mentioned earlier, is a JVM-based language developed by [JetBrains]. JetBrains is well known for creating a powerful Java development IDE. Android Studio, the official Android IDE, is based on Intellij, as a plugin for the platform.

Kotlin is created using the thinking of Java developers, and Intellij as its main development IDE. For Android developers, there are two interesting features:
- For Java developers, Kotlin is very intuitive and very easy to learn. Most of the language is very similar to what we know, different places, its basic concept can quickly grasp it.
- it is used with our daily life IDE can be fully integrated without configuration. Android Studio can be very perfect to understand, compile and run Kotlin code. And the support of this language is from the development of the IDE itself, so we Android developers are first class citizens.
 
But this is only the integration between development language and development tools. Compared to the advantages of Java 7 in the end what is it?
- it is more easy to show: this is one of its most important advantages. You can write much less code.
- it is more secure: Kotlin is empty security, that is to say in our compile time to deal with a variety of null situation, to avoid the implementation of abnormal. If an object can be null, we need to explicitly specify it and then check that it is null before using it. You can save a lot of debugging empty pointer abnormal time to solve the null caused by the bug.
- it is functional: Kotlin is based on object-oriented language. But as with many other modern languages, it uses a lot of functional programming concepts, such as using lambda expressions to more easily solve the problem. One of the great features is the collection of the way.
- it can extend the function: This means that we can extend the class of more features, and even we do not have permission to access the code in this class.
- it is highly interoperable: you can continue to use all the code and libraries you write in Java, because the interoperability between the two languages ​​is perfect. Even in a project using Kotlin and Java two languages ​​mixed programming.
