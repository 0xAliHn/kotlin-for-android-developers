# Extra function

Through the data class, we can easily get a lot of interesting functions, some from the property, we have already talked about (from the preparation of getter and setter function):

- equals(): It can compare the properties of the two objects to make sure they are the same.
- hashCode(): We can get a hash value, but also calculated from the attributes.
- copy(): You can copy an object, you can according to your needs to modify the inside of the property. We will see in later examples.
- ä¸€The series can map objects to functions in variables. I will soon be talking about this.
