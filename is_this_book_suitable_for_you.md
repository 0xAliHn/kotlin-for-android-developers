# Is this book suitable for you?

Write this book is to help those interested in using Kotlin language to develop Android developers.

If you meet the following situations, then this book is for you:
- You have the basics of Android development and Android SDK.
- You want to follow Kotlin using an example written in Kotlin.
- you need a guide on how to use a more concise and vivid language to solve typical problems encountered in everyday life.

On the other hand, this book may not be right for you because:
- This book is not the Kotlin Bible. I will explain all the basic grammar of Kotlin, and even include some of the more complex ideas I need in the process. So you are going through an example to learn, not the other way.
- I will not explain how to develop an Android application. You do not need to develop knowledge very well, but at least understand the basics, such as Android Studio, Gradle, Java and Android SDK. You may learn some new things about Android development.
- This book is not a functional programming language guide. Of course, because Java 7 is not a functional style, I will explain what you need to know, but not very in-depth to explain the topic of functional programming.
