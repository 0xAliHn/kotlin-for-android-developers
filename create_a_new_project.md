# Create a new project

If you are already used to Android Studio and Gradle, this chapter will be quite easy. I don’t want to
give many details nor screens, because UI changes from time to time and these lines won’t be useful
anymore.

Our app is consisting on a simple weather app, such as the one used in [Google's Beginners Course in Udacity]. We’ll be probably paying attention to different things, but the idea of the app will be
the same, because it includes many of the things you will find in a typical app. If your Android level
is low I recommend this course, it’s really easy to follow.
