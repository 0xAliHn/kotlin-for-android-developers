# Create a new project

If you have already used Android Studio and Gradle, then this chapter will be relatively simple. I will not give you a lot of details and screenshots, because the user interface and details may change.

Our application is made up of a simple weather app, just as used by [Google's Beginners Course in Udacity]. We may be concerned about different things, but the app idea is the same, you will find in a typical app which will include a lot of different things. If your Android development level is relatively low, I recommend this, this process is relatively easy.
