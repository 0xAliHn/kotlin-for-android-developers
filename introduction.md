# Introduction

If you think Java 7 is an outdated language and decide to find a more modern language instead. Congratulations! As you know, although Java 8 has been released, it contains a lot of improvements we expect in modern languages, but we Android developers are still forced to use Java 7. This is because of legal issues. But even if there is no such restriction, and the new Android device from today to start using the new Java8 to understand the VM, the current equipment expired, almost no one to use them before we can not use Java 8, so I am afraid we will not soon wait The day comes.

But it is not a remedy. Thanks to the use of the JVM, we can use any language to write Android applications, as long as it can be compiled into JVM can recognize the bytecode on it.

As you think, there are many options, such as Groovy, Scala, Clojure, and of course Kotlin. Through practice, only some of them can be considered as alternatives.

Each of the above languages has its pros and cons, and if you have not really determined which language you should use, I suggest you can try them out.
