# Introduction

You’ve decided that Java 7 is obsolete and you deserve a more modern language. Congratulations! As you may know, even with Java 8 out there, which includes many of the improvements we would expect from a modern language, we Android developers are still obliged to use Java 7. This is part because of legal issues. But even without this limitation, if new Android devices today started shipping a virtual machine able to run Java 8, we could’t start using it until current Android devices are so obsolete that almost nobody uses them. So I’m afraid we won’t see this moment soon.

But not everything is lost. Thanks to the use of the Java Virtual Machine ( JVM), we can write Android apps using any language that can be compiled to generate bytecode, which JVM is able to understand.

As you can imagine, there are a lot of options out there, such as Groovy, Scala, Clojure and, of course, Kotlin. In practice, only some of them can be considered real alternatives.

There are pros and cons on any of these languages, and I suggest you to take a look to some of them if you are not really sure which language you should use.
