# Android Studio

The first thing is to install Android Studio. As you know, Android Studio is the official Android IDE, it is a preview release released in 2013, and in 2014 released the official version.

Android Studio is a plug-in implementation of [Intellij IDEA], which is developed by [JetBrains], which Kotlin creates for JetBrains. So, as you can see, everything is so tightly combined.

Moving Android Studio is an important change for Android developers. First, because we gave up Eclipse and went to the perfect language for software developers designed for Java developers. We can enjoy the perfect characteristics of the experience, such as rapid response and impact of intelligent code prompts, there are powerful analysis and reconstruction tools.

Second, [Gradle] became the official Android system builder, which means new possibilities for version building and deployment. The most interesting two points are system build and flavors, which allow you to use the same code base to create an infinite version (or even a different application).

If you are still using Eclipse, in order to keep up with this book, I am afraid you need to transfer to Android Studio. Kotlin team also created a plug-in for Eclipse, but it is far behind Android Studio, and the combination was not perfect. Once you've used it, you'll feel like it's going to meet you later.

I will not cover the use of Android Studio and Gradle, because these are not the focus of this book, but if you have not used these tools before, do not panic, I am sure you can follow the book at the same time to learn the relevant foundation.
