# Android Studio
First thing you need is to have Android Studio installed. As you may know, Android Studio is the
official Android IDE, which was publicly presented in 2013 as a preview and finally released in 2014.


Android Studio is implemented as a plugin over [Intellij IDEA], a Java IDE created by  [JetBrains], the
company which is also behind Kotlin. So, as you can see, everything is tightly connected.

The adoption of Android Studio was an important change for Android developers. First, because
we left behind the buggy Eclipse and moved to a software specifically designed for Java developers,
which gives us a perfect interaction with the language. We enjoy awesome features such as a fast and
impressively smart code completion, or really powerful analysing and refactor tools among others.


And second, [Gradle] became the official build system for Android, which meant a whole bunch of
new possibilities related to version building and deploy. Two of the most interesting functions are
build systems and f lavours, which let you create infinite versions of the app (or even different apps)
in an easy way while using the same code base.

If you are still using Eclipse, I’m afraid you need to switch to Android Studio if you want to follow
this book. The Kotlin team is creating a plugin for Eclipse, but it will be always far behind the one
for Android Studio, and the integration won’t be so perfect. You will also discover what you are
missing really soon as you start using it.

I’m not covering the use of Android Studio or Gradle because this is not the focus of the book, but
if you haven’t used these tools before, don’t panic. I’m sure you’ll be able to follow the book and
learn the basics in the meanwhile.
