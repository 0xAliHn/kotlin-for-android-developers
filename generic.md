# Generic

Generic programming involves writing algorithms without specifying the exact type used in the code. In this way, we can create functions or types, the only difference is that they use different types, improve the reusability of the code. This code unit is what we know the generics, they exist in many languages, including Java and Kotlin.

In Kotlin, generics are even more important because frequent use of the extended function will multiply the frequency of our generic use. Although we have used generics blindly in this book, generics are usually more difficult in any language, so I try to use it as simple as possible to explain it, so that the main idea will be enough Clear.
